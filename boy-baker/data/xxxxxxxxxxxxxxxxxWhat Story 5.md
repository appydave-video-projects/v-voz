What Story 5.7 needs: UI to navigate between these 3 concepts within the same beat.

  ---
  Questions for You (Story 5.7 Q&A):

  Q1: How should users navigate between concepts?
  - A) Tabs (Concept 1 | Concept 2 | Concept 3)? YES
  - B) Dropdown selector?
  - C) Carousel with prev/next buttons?
  - D) Vertical stack (scroll through all)?

  The current page uses tabs now it's been using tabs to go between images now I like the tabs. It's just that it's focused on the wrong data hierarchy level.
  Across the top, we should be seeing concepts now we have a little bit of a problem because the concept is a fairly long string
  And that leads me to suspect that we may not even have the right data to represent these headings
  Now I'm happy to backfill our Jason document with concept headings, but we're gonna have to do that using Claude code and not programmatically it's gonna be a bit of a task to be honest
  Because it also needs to be done across all the projects so maybe we need a script but it needs to be a script that can figure out what the concept is going to be
  So maybe for now, we just go with concept one two and three, et cetera which at the moment means everything is just concept one but maybe we can fake out a concept two in the boy in the Baker story just so that we can see the data
  

  Q2: How should current concept be indicated?
  - A) Highlighted tab?
  - B) Progress indicator ("Concept 2 of 3")?
  - C) Both?

  Q3: Should concept attributes be displayed?
  - A) Yes, show all (description, setting, mood, characters)?
  - B) Show summary only (description)?
  - C) Progressive disclosure (expandable)?

  Q4: How do variations relate to concepts?
  - A) Each concept has its own variations (show only current concept's variations)?
  - B) Show all variations with concept grouping?

  Q5: URL behavior when switching concepts?
  - A) Update URL (/story/boy-baker/1?concept=2)?
  - B) Keep URL as-is (concept in component state only)?
