## vOz / SongShine Visual Style Guide Brief (v1.4)

### 1. **Core Visual Philosophy**

This project blends hand-drawn warmth with narrative restraint. It is inspired by Studio Ghibli, 90s RPGs, and storybook art — emotional but grounded, metaphorical without fantasy excess. The visuals support a quiet, reflective story about compassion, dignity, and rising above cruelty.

---

### 2. **Historical & Cultural Setting**

The story is set in a **fictional French village during the 1930s**, a time marked by hardship and quiet resilience.
The village feels humble and handmade — cobblestone streets, red-tiled roofs, wooden shutters, painted signage.
The baker is possibly of **Greek-French heritage**, running a small shop as a trusted but slightly outsider figure.
The time and setting justify the boy’s homelessness, the absence of safety nets, and the grim sentence passed by a detached justice system.

This hybrid context allows for grounded realism with soft poetic touches and echoes of European illustrated books.

### 3. **Color Palette** *(To be swatched with visual references)*

* **Primary Tones:**

  * Soft browns, warm earth tones, dusty oranges
  * Muted greens and plant tones
  * Sky blues that gradient into soft peach
* **Accent Colors:**

  * Brick red (roofs, signage)
  * Faded yellow (cloth, light)
  * Charcoal gray (shadows, jail bars)

### 4. **Style Anchors**

#### 🪵 Anchor #1: The Shop (Environment)

* Cozy, asymmetrical storefront with visible clutter
* Earth tones and wood textures
* Soft golden light, tactile warmth
* **Always located on a corner between a main road and an alley**

#### 👥 Anchor #2: Boys in the Alley (Characters)

* Semi-anime features, expressive eyes, youthfully stylized realism
* Modern clothing with a rustic palette
* Natural body language, emotional storytelling

#### 🧭 Anchor #3: Outdoor Youth Group (Adventure Ensemble)

* Rolled sleeves, boots, satchels
* Slightly heroic framing
* Hand-painted softness with defined silhouette

#### 🎨 Character Visual Anchor

* Final character visuals align with a semi-anime, storybook realism — gentle texture, expressive eyes, and warm, earth-toned palettes. Consistency preserved across portrait and scene renders.

### 5. **Scene Concept Anchors**

| # | Concept             | Description                                                        |
| - | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Dusty Street Corner | Transitional village edge, signs of wear, low sun                  |
| 2 | Bakery Interior     | Soft light, wooden textures, flour-dusted surfaces, aroma-rich air |
| 3 | Back Alley          | Quiet, shadowed, partially hidden from street                      |
| 4 | Village Center      | Loose square of buildings, background activity                     |
| 5 | Countryside Road    | Winding path, fences, trees, journey energy                        |
| 6 | Riverbank           | Still water, tall grass, moment of reflection                      |
| 7 | Hill Overlook       | Viewpoint for transformation or closure                            |
| 8 | Courtroom           | Village hall-style space, rustic wood and stone                    |
| 9 | Jail Cell           | Sparse, cold stone, barred light, emotional weight                 |

### 6. **Texture & Linework**

* Visible hand-drawn texture or watercolor grain
* Clean but **not** vector-perfect lines
* Layered depth using subtle outlines + color blending
* Painterly, never plastic
* All environments, props, and characters share a unified semi-anime, painterly aesthetic. This ensures visual coherence across scenes. Textures remain hand-rendered in feel; nothing should appear digitally sterile or overly polished.

---

### 7. **Lighting & Atmosphere**

* Lighting evolves with emotional tone across scenes
* **Warm golden light** for bakery and safe spaces
* **Cooler tones** in courtroom and jail scenes
* **Amber or radiant glow** in transformation/final moments
* Dust and particles catch sunlight indoors
* Shadows are soft-edged, deep but gentle

---

### 8. **DOs & DON'Ts**

| ✅ DO                            | ❌ DON'T                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Use soft, earthy palettes       | Use saturated neons or synthetic blues      |
| Layer clutter and asymmetry     | Frame with sterile, symmetrical layouts     |
| Embrace painterly softness      | Avoid hyper-real rendering or 3D plasticity |
| Express emotion through posture | Avoid deadpan or generic T-poses            |
| Use nature as a framing device  | Avoid sterile backdrops or minimalist voids |

### 13. **Animation Notes for Shot Decks**

When building scene-specific **Shot Decks**, include:

* Consistent bakery layout (always on corner of main road + alley)
* Suggested animation (with two variations) to convey character or emotional nuance

*Example:*
Scene: Learning to bake

* Animation 1: Boy kneads dough, baker watches, nods approvingly
* Animation 2: Baker guides boy’s hands gently, flour dusting the air
