He is crouched low, arms shielding his face, expression fearful. Surrounding him are four older children: a tall boy in a rolled-sleeve shirt and suspenders sneering down, a stocky boy in short trousers kicking dust forward, a thin lanky boy yanking the smaller boy's arm, and a short-haired girl in boots raising her foot to strike. Dust rises from their movements. Warm golden sunlight slices across the top of the alley wall, but the struggle happens in cool shadow, creating stark contrast.

At midground, the young boy (about 11, underweight) leans against a weathered plaster wall, bruised cheek, split lip, trembling; he wears an oversized dusty blue shirt over a faded cream undershirt, loose trousers, and scuffed shoes, arms half-raised defensively, visibly shaken. In the background, four older children flee: tall boy with suspenders, stocky boy in short trousers, thin lanky boy with messy hair, short-haired girl in boots.
