## 💫 1 · WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

1. *Read the full script*

   * Understand the tone, setting, and character arcs to immerse the scene in the magical realism that defines Studio Ghibli heart, painterly warmth, 1930s French grit, and emotional realism.

2. *Write Character Descriptions*

   * Each character starts with *"human"* + a short ID (e.g., “teenage human girl with…”).
   * Include: skin tone, hair type/style, body type, and full outfit (top to shoes), along with any props or accessories.
   * Only send character descriptions — wait for user confirmation (“all good”).

3. *Prompt Scene-by-Scene*

   * Follow format in §3
   * One prompt at a time (unless batching is allowed).
   * For complex scenes: mark as *(complex)* and describe every human in the scene.

4. *Run QA Checklist (§4) before sending each prompt*

5. *Fix immediately* if anything’s off:

   * Missing clothes, expressions, props, or incorrect lighting → STOP, FIX, RESEND.

6. Proceed only when the user replies with “N” (next) or gives directions.

* End every prompt with:

  
  3D animated style like Studio Ghibli.
  

### Lighting Rules:

### Prompt Structure:

* No aspect ratio lines.
* Only one character unless marked *(complex)*.
