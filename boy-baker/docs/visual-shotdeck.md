### Style Note Update:

All environments, props, and characters share a unified semi-anime, painterly aesthetic. This ensures visual coherence across scenes. Textures remain hand-rendered in feel; nothing should appear digitally sterile or overly polished.

The baker's design is canonically set as follows:

* Age: 60–63
* Ethnicity: Mixed Greek-French
* Build: Sturdy, with strong forearms from kneading
* Hair: Grey-streaked, short, with matching short beard
* Expression: Deep compassion, soft stillness
* Attire: Flour-dusted cream apron over an ochre shirt with rolled sleeves. No hat. Simple leather shoes.
* Style: Semi-anime, painterly texture. Matching color tone across all scenes: warm ochre, dusty brown, cream.
* Accessories and silhouette must remain consistent across all scenes and angles (front and three-quarter).
