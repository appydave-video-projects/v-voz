Here is the **Final Shot List** for *The Boy and the Baker*, designed with enough detail for the art department to visualize each scene. Symbolic elements (like the sparrow) and sensory cues (like aroma) are woven in subtly but intentionally.

---

### **Scene 1 – Exterior: Village Street, Early Morning**

The baker walks alone down a cobblestone street, past shuttered shops and sleepy windows. A **sparrow** perches on a nearby signpost, watching silently. In the distance, **a group of older boys encircle a smaller child**. The sky is a soft morning blue with golden light just touching the rooftops.

---

### **Scene 2 – Exterior: Alley**

Close-up of the gang pushing and hitting the boy. One kid grabs his shirt, another shoves him to the ground. The baker shouts from off-screen. The gang startles and runs. The boy stays curled, trembling.

---

### **Scene 3 – Exterior: Street Near Bakery**

The baker crouches beside the boy, who is bruised and wide-eyed. His torn shirt hangs off one shoulder. The baker gently places a steadying arm around him. In the background, villagers glance over but do not intervene.

---

### **Scene 4 – Interior: Bakery, Doorway**

They step inside. The light changes — soft and golden. Flour floats in the air. Wooden shelves curve with age. The shop **feels sacred**.

---

### **Scene 5 – Interior: Bakery (First Entrance)**

**The aroma of fresh bread fills the space** — rich, comforting, and warm. The boy inhales deeply. The contrast between outside cruelty and this sanctuary is palpable. His posture loosens just slightly.

---

### **Scene 6 – Interior: Bakery Kitchen**

The baker gestures toward the table. The boy stands off to the side. On the bench: sacks of flour, a bowl, eggs. The baker cracks eggs, stirs, kneads. The boy watches in silence, curiosity slowly overtaking fear.

---

### **Scene 7 – Interior: Bakery Kitchen (Time Lapse Feel)**

Dough covered with a towel. The baker teaches with few words. The boy sprinkles flour, begins kneading. There is **light through the window**, dust motes catching it. A bond forms — slow, quiet.

---

### **Scene 8 – Interior: Oven View**

The dough rises in the oven, golden and swelling. The baker speaks softly: *“It rises twice, just like we must.”* The boy’s eyes reflect the oven’s light.

---

### **Scene 9 – Interior: Shop Front, Twilight**

The baker wraps a small loaf in cloth and hands it to the boy. The boy hesitates, then accepts it reverently. They stand in silence. The sparrow is barely visible outside on the window sill.

---

### **Scene 10 – Exterior: Alley (Night)**

The boy sits in the shadows, eating bread slowly. A soft expression on his face — something like peace. Then, **footsteps**. The gang returns. Faces in shadow, intent unclear.

---

### **Scene 11 – Exterior: Crowd Gathers**

Morning. People murmur on the street. A policeman grabs the boy by the collar. The baker arrives, confused and alarmed. The boy looks stunned, face dirty, bread dropped and broken.

---

### **Scene 12 – Interior: Police Station**

The baker pleads with the **desk officer**, asking to speak to the boy. The mood is harsh, but the officer eventually agrees. A shadowed cell door creaks open.

---

### **Scene 13 – Interior: Jail Cell**

The boy sits small on the bench. The baker kneels beside the bars. The mood is dim and quiet. **No music, just breath and silence.** The boy tells the story. He is calm — not emotionless, but resigned. The baker listens, grief in his eyes.

---

### **Scene 14 – Interior: Courtroom**

The judge looms from a wooden bench. Sparse room. Wooden beams, faint light. The boy stands alone. No lawyer. No one speaks for him. The sentence is read. The baker watches from the back. The world feels **cold and indifferent**.

---

### **Scene 15 – Interior: Jail Cell, Final Visit**

The baker returns. The boy looks older now, or just more still. The baker brings a small loaf. He reminds the boy of the **two risings of bread**. *“You too shall rise again.”* There is no forced hope — just peace. The **sparrow perches outside** the barred window, bathed in amber morning light.
