## Piliero’s Dilemma:

**How one became two, two became three, three became two, two became one, one became none?**  
The tale of a point…

---

## ZERO

In the beginning there was nothing.  
Nothing being nothing is itself pointless, a zero.  
But a zero being nothing becomes a dot of nothingness.

---

## A POINT

A dot is a kind of point.  
The point having no direction  
**Compels itself to move forward in search of another.**

---

## DISCOVERY

As the point moved forward it discovers time, but no point.  
Having tired, the point pauses.  
As the point surveys the surface, turning — to its surprise — it finds a line.

---

## A LINE

Well, a line is fine but **where’s the point?**  
The perplexed point, not knowing a line, is confused.

---

## MOVING FORWARD

Looking forward, not seeing another point, the point shifts direction.  
As the point realigns its position, it finds the line is following.  
The point again shifts direction only to find in its way the original line.

---

## SEPARATION

The point jumps over the line and, looking back, sees separation — but still no point.  
The point is distraught and begins jumping up and down away from the line.

---

## GROWTH

Exhausted, the point stops jumping and looks — finding several other points.  
This pleases the point; not only has it found one point, but **many** other points.

---

## CURIOSITY

Well, the point moves forward to visit one of the points.  
But as they meet, the other point disappears.

---

## CONNECTION

The point, looking around, goes to another — only for it to disappear as well.  
And as the point continues to the remaining points, it finds they too disappear.

---

## TRANSFORMATION

But while all this is occurring, **something has changed** about the point.  
Once it arrived at its point of origination, now merged with other points — the line is transformed.

---

## A PATHWAY

Once discovering there is more than one point,  
The point — now a line — becomes a pathway connecting itself to others.  
Thus, completing the connection to become **a kind of circle**.

---

## THE CIRCLE

The point discovered that there is no point — **only the circle**.  
And once all points merge with one another, the line transforms into a circle.

---

## THE CYCLE

One continuous space where point, line, and time are joined to become a **whole**.  
Or is it a **hole** — a space you fall into?  
Maybe a **zero**… something whose nothing?

**Who knows what we become; but we truly are transformed!**

---

## CONCLUSION / BEGINNING

Thus, this is how:  
**One became two, two became three, three became two, two became one, one became none.**

The tale of a point…
