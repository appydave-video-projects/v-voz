# The Point - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
"The Point" is a philosophical animated narrative about a point's journey through void space, exploring themes of separation, unity, transformation, and cyclical existence.

## File Structure & Purpose

### Source Materials
- **data/source/transcript.txt** - Clean narrative text (v1), one paragraph per line
- **data/source/transcript-v2.txt** - Clean narrative text (v2), one paragraph per line
- **data/source/transcript-with-meta.md** - Full formatted version with metadata, chapter headers (v1)
- **data/source/transcript-with-meta-v2.md** - Full formatted version with metadata, chapter headers (v2)

### Planning & Philosophy Documents
- **data/philosophical-themes.md** - Core philosophical concepts the story explores (separation/unity, transformation, cyclical existence, meaning-making)
- **data/visualization-ideas.md** - Five different visual approaches to interpreting the story (2D plane, 3D void, microscopic/cosmic, living canvas, abstract geometry)
- **data/production-philosophy.md** - Multi-version production strategy using different mediums (AI generation, Remotion animation, mathematical rendering) as artistic statement against "AI slop"

## Version Differences
- **V1**: "One became two, two became three..." (original phrasing)
- **V2**: "None became one, one became two..." (updated phrasing emphasizing the cycle from zero)

## Production Vision
The project plans to create multiple versions of the same story using different production techniques over time, treating each version as an exploration of how medium shapes meaning. This positions intentional craft and medium selection as a response to low-effort AI content generation.
