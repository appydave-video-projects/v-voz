The Boy and the Baker by Vaz

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,359
An elderly baker walking to his shop sees a boy being bullied and beaten by a gang of older children.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,940
He shouts and the children run off.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,719
He goes to the boy who is bruised and shaken.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,620
The baker puts his arm around him and brings him into his shop.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,600
Once inside he asks the boy,

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,420
Where are your parents?

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,399
The boy meekly replies,

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,179
I have no parents. I'm all alone.

10
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,979
The baker sees a lost look in the boy's eyes.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,619
He understands the boy is one of many countless children who are abandoned and alone,

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,299
left to live on the streets fending for themselves.

13
00:00:53,299 --> 00:01:02,679
Like so many, he has no family, no experience, just a tenuous and dangerous future.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,840
The kind-hearted baker asks him if he'd like to help him make bread.

15
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,019
The boy nods his head and the baker takes him into his kitchen.

16
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:22,500
The boy watches as the baker assembles the ingredients, puts them in a bowl and mixes them together.

17
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,400
He sprinkles flour on a wooden table and begins kneading the dough.

18
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,959
Once he finished, he placed the dough in a pan and covered it with a towel.

19
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,219
Curious, the boy asks,

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,379
Why do you do this?

21
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:42,840
The baker replied,

22
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,219
Once the dough has formed, it needs time to rest and grow.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,019
After the dough had risen, the baker placed the uncooked bread into the oven.

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,420
They both watch as the bread begins to rise as it cooks.

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,340
The dough transforms into a brown, crusty, aromatic morsel of delight.

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,599
This is a miracle of life, the baker says,

27
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,860
How the bread rises to nourish our bodies and help us grow.

28
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,979
The baker smiles at the boy and gives him the bread as a gift.

29
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,879
The boy thanks the baker and exits the shop, returning to the streets.

30
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,960
Not far from the baker's shop, he finds an alley where he can rest and eat the bread.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,900
The next morning, as the baker arrives at his shop,

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,400
he spots a crowd of people watching as a policeman arrests a boy.

33
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,460
The baker runs to him and asks,

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,180
What has the boy done?

35
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,060
He replies,

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,439
The boy killed a man.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,060
The baker, not understanding, follows them to the police station.

38
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:06,060
The boy is taken into the back, and the baker asks the jailer,

39
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,740
May I speak with the boy?

40
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,900
The jailer nods and gives his approval.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
Once in the cell, he asks,

42
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,439
What happened to my boy?

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,139
The boy replies,

44
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,319
When I went to eat the bread, the others saw what I had.

45
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,439
They attacked me, and during the fight one of the boys was severely injured.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,979
I guess he must have died.

47
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,979
I don't know how it happened, but I was the only one there when the policeman arrived.

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,419
After a few days, the boy was taken before a judge.

49
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,379
In the courtroom, no one was there to speak for the boy,

50
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,300
only the baker, alone sitting in the back.

51
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,080
The boy was found guilty and convicted of murder.

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,599
With a stern look, the judge sentenced him to death.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,699
On the day of his execution, the boy received a visitor.

54
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,539
It was the kind-hearted baker with a loaf of bread in his hand.

55
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,019
The boy, seeing his only friend, begins to cry.

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,279
The baker smiles at him, and in a reassuring voice says,

57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,899
Do you remember the night in my shop when we baked bread?

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,740
Yes, the boy replies.

59
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,759
I spoke of the miracle of the bread.

60
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,519
Well, there is a second miracle.

61
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,439
You saw how the bread rose once in the pan and rose again in the oven?

62
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,819
He nodded yes.

63
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,500
Be strong, my son. You too shall rise like this bread.

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,839
Bread is the body of Christ from which all gain nourishment and life.

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,839
Amen.
