      "notes": "IF POSSIBLE: the baker looks like a giant, can his proportion be slightly smaller?\n\nThe way he is walking looks like he is walking on air rather than the pavement, it does not mesh into the scene cleanly, this is a known issue with the video tech and over time we need to improve.\n\nScene Observations:\nThe voice and the scene are in sync: Good\nThe feet don't have shadow, so it looks like he is floating.\nThe baker has perspective, but as he gets bigger, he does start to look like a giant compared to the building on the left.\n\nAnother visual discrepency may be because the scene is misty morning but the characters are hard focussed.\n\nVideo Observations:\n\nCharacter vs Background, both a Studio Ghibli French 1930 style, but the backgrounds are soft pencil and kind of blured while the characters are hard pencil and more cartoonish, and when creating video is important that we alignment early in the processs or we use an AI tool that solves that at generation.",
